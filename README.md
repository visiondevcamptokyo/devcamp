DevCamp is an experimental visionOS application created to serve as [VisionDevCamp Tokyo](https://www.vdctokyo.org/en)’s digital gathering space.
Despite not being an official app, it’s born from a global developer community and aims to nurture an open, decentralized developer ecosystem.
With photorealistic avatars and an immersive shared space, DevCamp brings the feeling of face-to-face communication anywhere in the world, no matter where you are.

The main differences from VRChat are as follows:
- It adopts the open protocol called nostr, designed for building decentralized, censorship-resistant social media.
- It provides near face-to-face communication through photorealistic avatars.
- It has a simple design optimized for communication and collaboration, keeping entertainment elements to a minimum.
