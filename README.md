DevCamp is an experimental visionOS application created to serve as VisionDevCamp’s digital gathering space. 
Despite not being an official app, it’s born from a global developer community and aims to nurture an open, decentralized developer ecosystem. 
With photorealistic avatars and an immersive shared space, DevCamp brings the feeling of face-to-face communication anywhere in the world, no matter where you are.
