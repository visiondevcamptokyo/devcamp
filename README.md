# DevCamp
A VRChat-like [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) client for visionOS.

The main differences from VRChat are as follows:

It adopts the open protocol called nostr, designed for building decentralized, censorship-resistant social media.

It provides near face-to-face communication through photorealistic avatars.

It has a simple design optimized for communication and collaboration, keeping entertainment elements to a minimum.

DevCamp is an experimental visionOS application created to serve as [VisionDevCamp](https://www.vdctokyo.org/en)’s digital gathering space.

With photorealistic avatars and an immersive shared space, DevCamp brings the feeling of face-to-face communication anywhere in the world, no matter where you are.
