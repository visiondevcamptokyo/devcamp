"How will our lives and society change when we expand the entire space into a display?"

From mainframes to personal computers and mobile devices, the evolution of technology has now reached a new frontierâ€”**Spatial Computing**. As smartphones, wearables, and XR technologies continue to develop, spatial computing is paving the way for an entirely new digital experience.

With the deep integration of AI and a wide range of interconnected devices, we can expect unprecedented experiences and value creation.

In this Ideathon, we will explore and shape new **lifestyles powered by spatial computing and AI**. Participants from various backgrounds will collaborate beyond technical and design boundaries to generate innovative ideas from multiple perspectives.
