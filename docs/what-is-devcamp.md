# What is DevCamp?

<!-- DevCamp is a  community-driven experimental visionOS application created to serve as VisionDevCamp’s digital gathering space. Despite not being an official app, it’s born from a global developer community and aims to nurture an open, decentralized ecosystem. With photorealistic avatars and an immersive shared space, DevCamp brings the feeling of face-to-face communication anywhere in the world, no matter where you are. -->

DevCamp is a VRChat-like [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) client for visionOS.

In a nutshell, it allows people to gather in a digital space built on an open protocol to interact and share content and experiences as if they were face-to-face.

## The Why

When this project first began, online participants had to exchange contact information and share a FaceTime link if they wanted to experience the same level of immersion as meeting in person.

Because of this, DevCamp was created to serve as VisionDevCamp’s online gathering space and started as an experimental project to explore new ways of collaboration.

Although it is not an official app, it has been community-driven, developed as open source, and adopts nostr.

Together with the global developer community, we aim to foster an open and decentralized developer ecosystem.

## What's the differences from VRChat?

The main differences from VRChat are as follows:
1. It adopts the open protocol called nostr, designed for building decentralized, censorship-resistant social media.
2. It provides near face-to-face communication through photorealistic avatars.
3. It has a simple design optimized for communication and collaboration, keeping entertainment elements to a minimum.
