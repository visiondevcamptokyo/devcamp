# What is DevCamp?

<!-- DevCamp is a  community-driven experimental visionOS application created to serve as VisionDevCamp's digital gathering space. Despite not being an official app, it's born from a global developer community and aims to nurture an open, decentralized ecosystem. With photorealistic avatars and an immersive shared space, DevCamp brings the feeling of face-to-face communication anywhere in the world, no matter where you are. -->

DevCamp is a VRChat-like [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) client for visionOS.

In a nutshell, it allows people to gather in a digital space built on an open protocol to interact and share content and experiences as if they were face-to-face.

## Background

When we first started planning [VisionDevCamp Tokyo 2025](https://www.vdctokyo.org/), we thought how wonderful it would be if we could provide an online venue where people could interact as if they were face-to-face, allowing participants from anywhere in the world to join the hackathon.

While Spatial Personas offer immersive face-to-face-like interactions, online participants needed to exchange contact information and share a FaceTime link to interact using them.

Because of this, DevCamp was created to serve as VisionDevCamp's online gathering space and started as an experimental project to explore new ways of collaboration.

Although it is not an official app, it has been community-driven, developed as open source, and adopts [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr).

Together with the global developer community, we aim to foster an open and decentralized developer ecosystem.

## What's the differences from VRChat?

The main differences from VRChat are as follows:

- It adopts the open protocol called Nostr, designed for building decentralized, censorship-resistant social media.
- It provides near face-to-face communication through photorealistic avatars.
- It has a simple design optimized for communication and collaboration, keeping entertainment elements to a minimum.
